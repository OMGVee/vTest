		<p><img class="left" src="images/sample-logo.jpg" alt="Sample image, aligned left" />This is Variant Classic, a free website template based on the design that was used on <a href="http://andreasviklund.com/">andreasviklund.com</a> until the site was re-designed on September 1st 2010. The name of the template comes from the fact that this kind of 3-column layout has been very popular for several years, and that it is still widely used on blogs and websites all over the world. In short, it is a layout that feels familiar which makes it easy to navigate. The two sidebars (which can be reduced to one single sidebar column if wanted) provides space for a lot of links and widgets, which is especially useful on blogs.</p>
		<p>To make it easier to build blog themes and CMS templates based on Variant Classic, styles and code examples for common blog features such as comments/contact form, search form, breadcrumb navigation, previous/next page links, post meta, post tags and RSS link are included.</p>
